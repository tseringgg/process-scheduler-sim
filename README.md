# CPU Scheduling Simulation

## Description
This project simulates several job scheduling algorithms, such as round robin, first come first serve, multilevel feedback queue, and shortest process next. I was one of the few students in my class to implement the finest details of these algorithms, demonstrating a deep understanding of CPU scheduling.

## Features
- Simulation of multiple CPU scheduling algorithms.
- Comparison of algorithm performance metrics.
- Visual representation of job scheduling.

## Tech Stack
- C++
- Command-line interface
